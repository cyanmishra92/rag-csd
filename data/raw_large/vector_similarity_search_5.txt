Document about Vector Similarity Search


        Scaling vector similarity search to large datasets presents significant challenges. Exact
        nearest neighbor search becomes prohibitively expensive as dimensions and dataset size increase,
        a phenomenon known as the "curse of dimensionality." To address this, approximate nearest
        neighbor (ANN) algorithms sacrifice some accuracy for dramatic performance improvements.
        Popular ANN techniques include locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), hierarchical navigable small
        world graphs (HNSW), product quantization (PQ), and inverted file with product quantization (IVF+PQ).
        


        Vector similarity search is the computational process of finding vectors in a dataset that
        are most similar to a query vector according to some distance metric. This operation forms
        the foundation of many modern AI applications, including semantic search, recommendation
        systems, image retrieval, and anomaly detection. The goal is to efficiently identify the
        k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to the query vector in a potentially very large vector space.

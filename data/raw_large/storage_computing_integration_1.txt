Document about Storage Computing Integration


        Storage-computing integration offers significant benefits for data-intensive applications.
        By performing computations closer to where data resides, systems can achieve lower latency,
        higher throughput, and improved energy efficiency. This paradigm shift is particularly
        relevant for big data analytics, AI/ML workloads, database operations, and edge computing
        scenarios where processing large volumes of data with limited resources is essential.
        


        Implementation approaches for storage-computing integration include specialized hardware
        (CSDs, smart SSDs, FPGAs with embedded storage), software frameworks that optimize data
        locality, and hybrid architectures that selectively offload operations. Challenges in this
        domain include programming model complexity, cost-effectiveness, standardization, and
        compatibility with existing software ecosystems. Despite these challenges, the trend toward
        tighter storage-computing integration continues to grow as data volumes increase and
        traditional architectures reach their scaling limits.

Document about Vector Databases


        The core functionality of vector databases is approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which
        finds the most similar vectors to a query vector based on distance metrics like cosine similarity,
        Euclidean distance, or dot product. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matches,
        vector databases optimize for similarity-based retrieval, trading off some accuracy for significant
        performance improvements.
        


        Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and search vector
        embeddings efficiently. These embeddings are numerical representations of data objects such as
        text, images, or audio, generated by machine learning models. Vector databases provide specialized
        indexes and algorithms for similarity search operations, which are essential for applications like
        semantic search, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.

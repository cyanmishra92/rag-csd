Document about Retrieval Augmented Generation


        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that combines the strengths of
        retrieval-based systems with generative models. In a RAG system, a retrieval component first
        fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this
        retrieved context to produce more accurate, factual, and contextually appropriate responses.
        This approach enhances the capabilities of large language models by giving them access to
        external knowledge beyond their training data.
        


        RAG offers several advantages over pure generative models, including improved factuality,
        reduced hallucination, greater transparency (as sources can be cited), and the ability to
        access up-to-date information without retraining. RAG systems are particularly valuable for
        question answering, chatbots, summarization, and any application where factual accuracy and
        recency of information are important. They can be customized by changing the knowledge base
        to adapt to different domains or use cases.

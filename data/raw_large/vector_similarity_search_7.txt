Document about Vector Similarity Search


        Scaling vector similarity search to large datasets presents significant challenges. Exact
        nearest neighbor search becomes prohibitively expensive as dimensions and dataset size increase,
        a phenomenon known as the "curse of dimensionality." To address this, approximate nearest
        neighbor (ANN) algorithms sacrifice some accuracy for dramatic performance improvements.
        Popular ANN techniques include locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), hierarchical navigable small
        world graphs (HNSW), product quantization (PQ), and inverted file with product quantization (IVF+PQ).
        


        Common distance metrics used in vector similarity search include cosine similarity (measuring
        the angle between vectors, ideal for text embeddings), Euclidean distance (measuring the
        straight-line distance, suitable for spatial data), dot product (measuring directional similarity),
        and Manhattan distance (measuring grid-like distance). The choice of metric depends on the nature
        of the data and the specific requirements of the application.

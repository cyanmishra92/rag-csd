Document about Retrieval Augmented Generation


        RAG offers several advantages over pure generative models, including improved factuality,
        reduced hallucination, greater transparency (as sources can be cited), and the ability to
        access up-to-date information without retraining. RAG systems are particularly valuable for
        question answering, chatbots, summarization, and any application where factual accuracy and
        recency of information are important. They can be customized by changing the knowledge base
        to adapt to different domains or use cases.
        


        The typical RAG architecture consists of three main components: (1) an embedding model that
        converts queries and documents into vector representations, (2) a retrieval system that finds
        the most relevant documents using vector similarity, and (3) a generation model that synthesizes
        the original query with the retrieved information to produce a response. This pipeline allows
        the system to ground its generations in specific, relevant facts from a trustworthy knowledge base.

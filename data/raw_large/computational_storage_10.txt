Document about Computational Storage


        The architecture of a typical CSD includes storage media (like NAND flash), an embedded processor
        (ARM cores, FPGA, or ASIC), and firmware that exposes computational capabilities. CSDs can be
        implemented as SSDs with added compute, FPGAs with storage, or custom ASICs. These devices typically
        connect via NVMe or PCIe interfaces and may support standards like NVMe Computational Storage.
        


        Key benefits of Computational Storage include reduced latency, decreased power consumption, improved
        application performance, and better resource utilization. By minimizing data movement between storage
        and the CPU, computational storage reduces the bottlenecks in traditional computing architectures.
        This approach is particularly valuable for applications dealing with large datasets, such as databases,
        analytics, and machine learning.

Document about Vector Similarity Search


        Vector similarity search is the computational process of finding vectors in a dataset that
        are most similar to a query vector according to some distance metric. This operation forms
        the foundation of many modern AI applications, including semantic search, recommendation
        systems, image retrieval, and anomaly detection. The goal is to efficiently identify the
        k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to the query vector in a potentially very large vector space.
        


        Common distance metrics used in vector similarity search include cosine similarity (measuring
        the angle between vectors, ideal for text embeddings), Euclidean distance (measuring the
        straight-line distance, suitable for spatial data), dot product (measuring directional similarity),
        and Manhattan distance (measuring grid-like distance). The choice of metric depends on the nature
        of the data and the specific requirements of the application.

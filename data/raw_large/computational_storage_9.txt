Document about Computational Storage


        Key benefits of Computational Storage include reduced latency, decreased power consumption, improved
        application performance, and better resource utilization. By minimizing data movement between storage
        and the CPU, computational storage reduces the bottlenecks in traditional computing architectures.
        This approach is particularly valuable for applications dealing with large datasets, such as databases,
        analytics, and machine learning.
        


        Computational Storage is a new computing paradigm that moves processing closer to where data is stored.
        It helps reduce data movement and improves performance for data-intensive applications.
        Computational Storage Devices (CSDs) integrate computing capabilities directly with storage, enabling
        operations like filtering, aggregation, and transformation to be performed within the storage device itself.

Document about Computational Storage


        Computational Storage is a new computing paradigm that moves processing closer to where data is stored.
        It helps reduce data movement and improves performance for data-intensive applications.
        Computational Storage Devices (CSDs) integrate computing capabilities directly with storage, enabling
        operations like filtering, aggregation, and transformation to be performed within the storage device itself.
        


        The architecture of a typical CSD includes storage media (like NAND flash), an embedded processor
        (ARM cores, FPGA, or ASIC), and firmware that exposes computational capabilities. CSDs can be
        implemented as SSDs with added compute, FPGAs with storage, or custom ASICs. These devices typically
        connect via NVMe or PCIe interfaces and may support standards like NVMe Computational Storage.

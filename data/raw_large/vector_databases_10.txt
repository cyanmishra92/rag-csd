Document about Vector Databases


        Common indexing techniques in vector databases include tree-based methods (KD-trees, VP-trees),
        graph-based approaches (HNSW, NSG), and quantization methods (PQ, OPQ). These approaches create
        data structures that enable efficient navigation of the vector space to find nearest neighbors
        without exhaustive comparison. Popular vector database systems include FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search),
        Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant.
        


        The core functionality of vector databases is approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which
        finds the most similar vectors to a query vector based on distance metrics like cosine similarity,
        Euclidean distance, or dot product. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matches,
        vector databases optimize for similarity-based retrieval, trading off some accuracy for significant
        performance improvements.

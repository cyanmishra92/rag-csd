Document about Vector Databases


        Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and search vector
        embeddings efficiently. These embeddings are numerical representations of data objects such as
        text, images, or audio, generated by machine learning models. Vector databases provide specialized
        indexes and algorithms for similarity search operations, which are essential for applications like
        semantic search, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.
        


        Common indexing techniques in vector databases include tree-based methods (KD-trees, VP-trees),
        graph-based approaches (HNSW, NSG), and quantization methods (PQ, OPQ). These approaches create
        data structures that enable efficient navigation of the vector space to find nearest neighbors
        without exhaustive comparison. Popular vector database systems include FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search),
        Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant.

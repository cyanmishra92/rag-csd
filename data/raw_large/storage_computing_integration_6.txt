Document about Storage Computing Integration


        The integration of storage and computing represents a fundamental shift in system architecture,
        moving away from the traditional von Neumann model where data shuttles between separate storage
        and processing units. This integration takes various forms, including computational storage,
        near-data processing, in-memory computing, and processing-in-memory. These approaches share the
        common goal of reducing data movement, which has become a major bottleneck in terms of latency,
        energy consumption, and overall system performance.
        


        Storage-computing integration offers significant benefits for data-intensive applications.
        By performing computations closer to where data resides, systems can achieve lower latency,
        higher throughput, and improved energy efficiency. This paradigm shift is particularly
        relevant for big data analytics, AI/ML workloads, database operations, and edge computing
        scenarios where processing large volumes of data with limited resources is essential.

Document about Retrieval Augmented Generation


        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that combines the strengths of
        retrieval-based systems with generative models. In a RAG system, a retrieval component first
        fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, and then a generative model uses this
        retrieved context to produce more accurate, factual, and contextually appropriate responses.
        This approach enhances the capabilities of large language models by giving them access to
        external knowledge beyond their training data.
        


        The typical RAG architecture consists of three main components: (1) an embedding model that
        converts queries and documents into vector representations, (2) a retrieval system that finds
        the most relevant documents using vector similarity, and (3) a generation model that synthesizes
        the original query with the retrieved information to produce a response. This pipeline allows
        the system to ground its generations in specific, relevant facts from a trustworthy knowledge base.
